This plugin duplicates several features from [nuxeo-baws-bedrock-connector](https://github.com/nuxeo-sandbox/nuxeo-aws-bedrock-connector), especially all the work around using vector search with openSearch. As a start, it replaces the calls to AWS Bedrock to calls to [Hyland Content Intelligence](https://www.hyland.com/en), to calculate embedding, get the description of an image and tag an image with custom metadata.

So as of "today", the work is about getting code from nuxeo-baws-bedrock-connector, update the pom files to change group ID and artifact IDs, etc. etc.
